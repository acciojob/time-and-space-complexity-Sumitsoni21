	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity refers to how the runtime of an algorithm changes as the size of the input increases. Analyzing time complexity helps us determine whether an algorithm is efficient, especially when working with large datasets.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> represents the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. It is often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), which indicates that the memory usage grows linearly with the input size.
